# Quality of Life Shell Packages

This assumes that you should have `brew` installed, a macOSX package manager. A lot of this is courtesy of [this great github](https://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/Homebrew/Cask.html)

```sh
brew install bash-completion git
```


```sh
brew install --cask \
    qlcolorcode \
    qlstephen \
    qlmarkdown \
    quicklook-json \
    qlprettypatch \
    quicklook-csv \
    betterzip \
    webpquicklook \
    suspicious-package
```
