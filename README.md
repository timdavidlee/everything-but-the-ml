# Everything But the Machine Learning

### School of Machine Learning Engineering

This is an entry-level course designed to equip new `machine learning engineers` and `data scientists` with all the **supporting non-ml tech skills** to do technical jobs effectively. Too many a `data-science` contributer has flailed about trying to get into a server, or struggled at simple shell commands to peek into text files.

### The goal:

Your machine models should not be blocked because you don't know how to copy your files, where to put things, or where to get data!

- **YES**:
    - getting around file systems + moving stuff
    - manipulating files with shell commands
    - connecting to virtual machines
    - deploying services
    - common ETL mistakes

- **SORTA**:
    - `tensorflow` + `pytorch` in the context of memory usage + file management
    - `pandas` and `numpy` for speed + storage, not for feature development

- **NO**:
    - model algorithms covered
    - data science metrics or scoring discussed
